	  <p style = "background-color:darkslategray; color:white;"> For my first year in high school (2015), I started out in a high school in Florida named Cypress Creek High School where I got introduced into Information Technology which ended up being my major for St John's University. However, I transferred from that school in early 2016 and moved to New York. I continued my years of high school in High School for Construction Trades, Engineering, and Architecture. I decided to study engineering at that school where I learned computer, electrical and mechanical engineering. Once I graduated and got my diploma, I decided to go to St John's University and continue Information Technology. During my years in St John's, I've taken many IT classes like data analytics, computer programming, database management systems, systems analysis, cyber security, IT for business, and currently taking web development. </p>

I also enjoy working out with weights at home in my backyard. I also like to watch anime and tend to binge anime while doing work or gaming.

	      <p class = "p1"> In this assignment, we use CSS to style our HTML profile webpage from milestone one while following all the deliverables required for this project. To style the project with CSS, two additional CSS files were added to the project (mycss_web.css & mycss_tablet.css). Each file would contain its own unique styling which will then be linked to the original HTML webpage file. For example, the web CSS file would consist of the styling for the webpage while the tablet CSS file would distinguish how the webpage will be viewed on a different media device using responsive design. </p>
